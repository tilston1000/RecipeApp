# Recipe App

This project allows me to build a modern application, whilst also utilising a number of the skillsets I am acquiring whilst learning JavaScript. Some key aspects of this project are:

- loading recipes from an API, and rendering these on the site correctly
- utilising MVC architecture, specifically in relation to event handling(Publisher-Subscriber)
- introducing search functionality and, alongside this, pagination in the event that multiple pages of results are returned(this is configurable via the config.js)
- ability to automatically adjust the recipe ingredients volumes, based on the number of servings per recipe
- feature which allows the user to add a bookmark, thus providing the ability to quickly retrieve favourite recipes
- 'upload new recipe' feature so that new recipes can be added to the app. Some robust error handling has also been included here, so that only valid recipe data can be uploaded

This project has also been integrated with Netlify, from a CI perspective.
